## Steps to Get Started

First, we need to download the required packages and libs:

```bash
npm i .
```

Create a .env file and make sure to paste the correct mongodb string.

Ex. mongodb+srv://myusername:mypassword<span>@</span>cluster0.3o4wfho.mongodb.net/

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
